# Fromdocs for Python

Fromdocs is a library that allows extracting identification data from digital copies of some identification documents emited in Mozambique. The extracted data can be used to automate the completion of electronic forms and, with that the process becomes faster and less error prone.

Currently the set of documents supported by FromDocs include ID, NUIT, Passport and Driving license. The copies can be presented in PDF, JPG or PNG file formats.

## Usage

In order to use this library you should first import **DocumentReader** class from its package, you can proceed as instructed in the following snippet:

```java
import com.eltonlaice.DocumentReader;
```

Then you should create a DocumentReader instance passing a copy of the document and its type as arguments:

```java
DocumentReader reader  = new DocumentReader("/path/docfile.pdf", DocumentType.BI);
```

Finally you can extract data from the document like this:

```java
Document document = reader.getDocument();
String number = document.getNumber();
String lastName = document.getLastName();
String givenNames = document.getGivenNames();
LocalDate birthdate = document.getBirthdate();
String placeBirth = document.getPlaceBirth();
LocalDate dateIssue = document.getDateIssue();
```

## Prerequisites
